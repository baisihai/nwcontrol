# NWControl

## Introduction

Welcome! 

This is a time-based C# program to turn on/off Network connection on Windows OS.
For my personal use, I want to disable the network connection for the following two time ranges:
Time Range 1: 6pm to 11.59pm
Time Range 2: 12am to 6am

Feel free to modify according to your needs.
